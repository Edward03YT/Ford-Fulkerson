# 🚀 Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm Analyzer

A beautiful, interactive web-based tool for analyzing maximum flow problems using the **corrected Ford-Fulkerson algorithm**. This implementation finds ALL augmenting paths in each major iteration rather than processing them one by one.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Graph Builder** - Define nodes and edges with capacities
- 🔍 **Step-by-Step Analysis** - Detailed breakdown of each algorithm iteration
- 📊 **Visual Results** - Clear presentation of flow paths and edge saturation
- 🛠️ **Corrected Implementation** - Finds all augmenting paths per major iteration
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Beautiful glassmorphism design with smooth animations

### Example Input Format

**Nodes:** `x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8,x9`

**Edges with Capacities:**
```
x1-x2:20
x1-x3:30
x3-x2:8
x3-x5:9
x3-x6:10
x2-x4:15
x2-x5:10

   - View step-by-step algorithm execution
   - Examine final flow distribution

3. **Interpret Results**
   - Maximum flow value
   - Detailed iteration breakdown
   - Edge saturation status
   - Residual graph information

## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### What Makes This Implementation Special?

This is a **corrected version** of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm that:

- 🔄 **Finds ALL augmenting paths** in each major iteration
- ⚡ **More efficient** for graphs with multiple source connections
- 📈 **Better performance** on complex network flows
- 🎯 **Complete flow analysis** per iteration

### Traditional vs. Corrected Approach

| Traditional Ford-Fulkerson | Our Corrected Version |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Finds 1 path per iteration | Finds ALL paths per major iteration |
| May require more iterations | Fewer major iterations needed |
| Sequential path processing | Parallel path discovery |
